# FS-Mol: A Few-Shot Learning Dataset of Molecules

This repository contains data and code for FS-Mol: A Few-Shot Learning Dataset of Molecules.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install dependencies

   ```
   cd FS-Mol

   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate fsmol
   ```

The code for the Molecule Attention Transformer baseline is added as a submodule of this repository. Hence, in order to be able to run MAT, one has to clone our repository via `git clone --recurse-submodules`. Alternatively, one can first clone our repository normally, and then set up submodules via `git submodule update --init`. If the MAT submodule is not set up, all the other parts of our repository should continue to work.

## Data

The actual dataset is stored in `dataset/`, split into `train`, `valid` and `test` folders.
Tasks are stored as individual compressed [JSONLines](https://jsonlines.org/) files, with each line corresponding to the information to a single datapoint for the task.
Each datapoint is stored as a JSON dictionary, following a fixed structure:
```json
{
    "SMILES": "SMILES_STRING",
    "Property": "ACTIVITY BOOL LABEL",
    "Assay_ID": "CHEMBL ID",
    "RegressionProperty": "ACTIVITY VALUE",
    "LogRegressionProperty": "LOG ACTIVITY VALUE",
    "Relation": "ASSUMED RELATION OF MEASURED VALUE TO TRUE VALUE",
    "AssayType": "TYPE OF ASSAY",
    "fingerprints": [...],
    "descriptors": [...],
    "graph": {
        "adjacency_lists": [
           [... SINGLE BONDS AS PAIRS ...],
           [... DOUBLE BONDS AS PAIRS ...],
           [... TRIPLE BONDS AS PAIRS ...]
        ],
        "node_types": [...ATOM TYPES...],
        "node_features": [...NODE FEATURES...],
    }
}
```

### FSMolDataset
The `fs_mol.data.FSMolDataset` class provides programmatic access in Python to the train/valid/test tasks of the few-shot dataset.
An instance is created from the data directory by `FSMolDataset.from_directory(/path/to/dataset)`.
More details and examples of how to use `FSMolDataset` are available in `fs_mol/notebooks/dataset.ipynb`.

## Evaluating a new Model

We have provided an implementation of the FS-Mol evaluation methodology in `fs_mol.utils.eval_utils.eval_model()`.
This is a framework-agnostic python method, and we demonstrate how to use it for evaluating a new model in detail in `notebooks/evaluation.ipynb`.

Note that our baseline test scripts (`fs_mol/baseline_test.py`, `fs_mol/maml_test.py`, `fs_mol/mat_test`, `fs_mol/multitask_test.py` and `fs_mol/protonet_test.py`) use this method as well and can serve as examples on how to integrate per-task fine-tuning in TensorFlow (`maml_test.py`), fine-tuning in PyTorch (`mat_test.py`) and single-task training for scikit-learn models (`baseline_test.py`).

## Baseline Model Implementations

We provide implementations for three key few-shot learning methods: Multitask learning, Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning, and Prototypical Networks, as well as evaluation on the Single-Task baselines and the Molecule Attention Transformer (MAT) [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08264v1), [code](https://github.com/lucidrains/molecule-attention-transformer). 

All results and associated plots are found in the baselines/ directory. 

These baseline methods can be run on the FS-Mol dataset as follows:

### kNNs and Random Forests -- Single Task Baselines

Our kNN and RF baselines are obtained by permitting grid-search over a industry-standard parameter set, detailed in the script `baseline_test.py`.

The baseline single-task evaluation can be run as follows, with a choice of kNN or randomForest model:

```bash
python fs_mol/baseline_test.py /path/to/data --model {kNN, randomForest}
```

### Molecule Attention Transformer

The Molecule Attention Transformer (MAT) [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08264v1), [code](https://github.com/lucidrains/molecule-attention-transformer). 

The Molecule Attention Transformer can be evaluated as:

```bash
python fs_mol/mat_test.py /path/to/pretrained-mat /path/to/data
```

### GNN-MAML pre-training and evaluation

The GNN-MAML model consists of a GNN operating on the molecular graph representations of the dataset. The model consists of a $8$-layer GNN with node-embedding dimension $128$. The GNN uses "Edge-MLP" message passing. The model was trained with a support set size of $16$ according to the MAML procedure [Finn 2017](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/finn17a/finn17a.pdf). The hyperparameters used in the model checkpoint are default settings of `maml_train.py`.

The current defaults were used to train the final versions of GNN-MAML available here. 

```bash
python fs_mol/maml_train.py /path/to/data 
```

Evaluation is run as: 

```bash
python fs_mol/maml_test.py /path/to/data --trained_model /path/to/gnn-maml-checkpoint
```

### GNN-MT pre-training and evaluation

The GNN-MT model consists of a GNN operating on the molecular graph representations of the dataset. The model consists of a $10$-layer GNN with node-embedding dimension $128$. The model uses principal neighbourhood aggregation (PNA) message passing. The hyperparameters used in the model checkpoint are default settings of `multitask_train.py`. This method has similarities to the approach taken for the task-only training contained within [Hu 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12265v1)

```bash
python fs_mol/multitask_train.py /path/to/data 
```

Evaluation is run as: 

```bash
python fs_mol/multitask_test.py /path/to/gnn-mt-checkpoint /path/to/data
```

### Prototypical Networks (PN) pre-training and evaluation

The prototypical networks method [Snell 2017](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/file/cb8da6767461f2812ae4290eac7cbc42-Paper.pdf) extracts representations of support set datapoints and uses these to classify positive and negative examples. We here used the Mahalonobis distance as a metric for query point distance to class prototypes. 

```bash
python fs_mol/protonet_train.py /path/to/data 
```

Evaluation is run as: 

```bash
python fs_mol/protonet_test.py /path/to/pn-checkpoint /path/to/data
```

## Specifying, Training and Evaluating New Model Implementations

Flexible definition of few-shot models and single task models is defined as demonstrated in the range of train and test scripts in `fs_mol`. 

We give a detailed example of how to use the abstract class `AbstractTorchFSMolModel` in `notebooks/integrating_torch_models.ipynb` to integrate a new general PyTorch model, and note that the evaluation procedure described below is demonstrated on `sklearn` models in `fs_mol/baseline_test.py` and on a Tensorflow-based GNN model in `fs_mol/maml_test.py`.
